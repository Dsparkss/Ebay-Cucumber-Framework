Cucmber will have 3 major files

		feautre file
		Step definition  file 
		Testrunner file 

Feature file will have 

		Feature - will have one feature title .which describes the entire feature of the function or the page
		Step defintion - which will have all the step of the feature file 
		Test runner - which helps in running the step definiton file


Test Runner	
		features = {"Features"}, describe the packaeg file of the feature file
		glue= {"StepDefinition"}, StepDefintion file
		plugin= {"pretty", "html:Report"},   	//"json ,junit:Report" makes the report looks preety
		dryRun=false,  // runs only the feautre file 
		monochrome=true, // the console will  be neat
		tags={"@shoot"}   // giving tag name to the scenario so that only the particular tag gets executed
		name=""Logo) //Any sceanrio with the keyword logo will be executed

 Scenario Outline : It contains multiples scenario to run 
 					it consist of a keyword called Example where the data are provided in the form of data tables
 					The parameter must match with the header of the data table 
 					
 					
 	Scenario Outline: Validating the title and url of the following link
    Given user is on the home page
    When user clicks on the '<Link>'
    Then validate that page navigates to the '<url>' and title contains '<title>'

    Examples:

 @Before  and @After - Global Hooks [[only for before hooks ]are not Always executed first , it depends on the order of code written]
 
 Scenario tagged Hooks -
 
 		Are the hooks in which the scenraio are tagged and hooks with the tag name will be present 
 		[are not Always executed first , it depends on the order of code written]
 		After hooks are always executed first if the order is at last [it does not depends on the order they are opposite first inoreder means executed at last last i order means executed first]
 		
Example :
 @Book @search
 Scenario: Search for book 
 Given
 when
 
 Hooks - 
Before(@search)
public void setCookies(){

		System.out.println(" I will be executed before the Scenario which as tag name @search");
}
 
Priortizing the hooks order :

	[[[The Hooks with the order 0 will be executed at the first]]]
 
 @Before(order=1)
 @After(order=1) [executed at 1st]
 @Before(value = "@search" , order = 0)  
 
  [[[The code may be in which ever order but only the hooks with order value 0 will be executed at the first]]]
   
   
 C U C U M B E R  T A G S
 
 "a1 and a2 "  - scenario which has both the a1 and a2 tag will only run 
"a1 or a2" - Any scenario which has either  a1 or a2 tag will run or if both tags are present will run
